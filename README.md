# python-simple-questionnaire
Simple questionnaire script using classes. 

The purpose of this program is to explore the use of classes in Python, specifically constructors and inheritance. 
Three classes have been used for this exercise, namely 'Child' and 'Adult', as well as 'familyMember',
in which they inherit some functions from.

A summary of the user is then displayed depending on the answers given to the prompts.
